# Bantorra

This little piece of software is meant to help organise your vast anime collection.

## Requirements

Basically ATM you need linux box. I didn't bother making sure that python API is OS-independent when it comes to file-paths.

## Running the app

Easiest way is to install yarn (or npm), clone the repo, and then run:

```bash
	yarn start
	yarn start-api
```

Then everything is accessible under http://localhost:3000

You need to make sure that the user you're running the app as can move and create directories on the source and destination paths!
